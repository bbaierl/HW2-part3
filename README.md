# HW2-part3

I found this homework to be quite hard with not much knowledge of assembly. We had barely done examples in class and I feel as though
this homeowork was not fair and extremely long to try and figure out.

With that being said all of my c codes are named Q#.c depending on which problem they are for.

My explanations to Q1-Q3 are in the text file and my attempt at Q4 is in the pdf file along with the IDA screenshots.
